        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 my-4">FAANG is proud to introduce ExoplANNET, our new service feature that utilizes the power of neural networks to revolutionize exoplanet detection. With ExoplANNET, astronomers and researchers can now detect planetary signals in radial velocity data with greater accuracy and speed. Our deep learning algorithm is trained to classify planetary signals in the data, resulting in fewer false positives and a faster execution time compared to traditional methods.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 my-4">The challenges of detecting exoplanets in radial velocity data are well-known in the astronomy community. Instrument errors and noise from the star can make it difficult to distinguish planetary signals from other phenomena. ExoplANNET's advanced machine learning capabilities allow it to detect exoplanets even in noisy data, making it a valuable tool for researchers studying the cosmos.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 my-4">ExoplANNET is a faster and more accurate approach to exoplanet detection. Our deep learning algorithm is trained on a large dataset of radial velocity data, enabling it to classify planetary signals with high precision. This results in fewer false positives and a faster execution time compared to traditional methods.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 my-4">At FAANG, we're committed to advancing the field of exoplanet detection and providing astronomers with the tools they need to make groundbreaking discoveries. Join us in exploring the mysteries of the universe with ExoplANNET.</p>
