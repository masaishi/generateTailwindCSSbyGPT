                <p class="text-lg mb-4">Traditional methods of detecting exoplanets in radial velocity data are time-consuming and prone to false positives due to instrument errors and noise from the star. ExoplANNET is a deep learning algorithm that is trained to classify planetary signals in the radial velocity data. It performs better than traditional methods, with fewer false positives and a faster execution time.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How ExoplANNET Works</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">ExoplANNET is a deep learning algorithm that uses neural networks to classify planetary signals in radial velocity data. The algorithm is trained on a large dataset of simulated data, and is able to detect planetary signals with high accuracy and low false positive rates. The algorithm is designed to be fast and efficient, enabling astronomers to process large amounts of data quickly and easily.</p>
