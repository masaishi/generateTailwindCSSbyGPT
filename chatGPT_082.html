                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">What is ExoplANNET?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">ExoplANNET is a deep learning algorithm designed to detect exoplanets in radial velocity data. It is a faster and more accurate approach than traditional methods, and has the potential to revolutionize the field of exoplanet detection.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">How does it work?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">ExoplANNET is a neural network algorithm trained to classify planetary signals in radial velocity data. It works by analyzing the patterns and variations in a star's radial velocity caused by an orbiting planet, and is able to distinguish these signals from instrument errors and noise in the data.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Why is it important?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">ExoplANNET has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of exoplanet detection, which is a crucial step in the search for habitable worlds and extraterrestrial life. By automating the detection process and reducing the number of false positives, ExoplANNET can help astronomers focus their resources on the most promising candidates for further study.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">How can it be used?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">ExoplANNET can be used by astronomers and researchers interested in exoplanet detection, as well as by space agencies and private companies involved in the search for habitable worlds. It has the potential to be integrated into existing astronomical software and instruments, and to be used in future space missions.</p>
