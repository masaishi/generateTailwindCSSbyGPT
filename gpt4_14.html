                <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Performance Monitoring</h3>
                <p>DriftMinder uses NannyML's performance estimation algorithms (CBPE and DLE) to provide real-time analysis of your model's performance. You can monitor your model's accuracy and receive alerts when the performance drops below a certain threshold.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Data Drift Detection</h3>
                <p>DriftMinder tracks data drift using NannyML's new approach to multivariate data drift detection with PCA-based data reconstruction. This helps you identify changes in the underlying input data distribution that may affect your model's performance, and receive alerts when data drift exceeds the set threshold.</p>
